## Move static content to `static`
Jekyll has a rule that any directory not starting with `_` will be copied as-is to the `_site` output. Hugo keeps all static content under `static`. You should therefore move it all there.
With Jekyll, something that looked like

    ▾ <root>/
        ▾ images/
            logo.png
